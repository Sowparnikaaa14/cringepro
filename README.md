### Project Description
LOVEJAM is a webpage that generates some random reasons for "Why I love you" as a small gift for someone you like. The main inspiration for this is to dedicate for the ones who love making handmade gifts for their loved ones, These random reasons for why i love you will help you create cute notes to give it your favourite person to make them feel special and also happy through these small gestures. Rather than cringe, I might say it's quite romantic and heart-warming. The main motive we meant through this is to create small chits of paper filled with reasons to why you love them by accesing the number of reasons through our site and it will provide you the amount of reasons you need and store it in a glass jar (as you store your favorite fruit jam in your jar lol..).Then voila, you created a perfect old fashion themed but still a cutesy gift to your valentines, or to your loved ones.
